# Prospectus Project 1

Implicit biases are present in our society, and they manifest in different situations.  These biases can affect our behavior without being aware of them. In this project, the question I will be answering is whether subject race affects police behavior, and whether this behavior changes depending on factors such as age, sex, time when the stop was made. Answering this question would allow us to understand what are the factors that could potentially affect being stopped by a police officer, and whether these factors affect the outcome of the stop (e.g., being arrested, given a warning). 

Data
The data source I will be using comes from the Stanford Policing Project, New Orleans. I chose New Orleans because it is one of the most complete datasets in terms of the measures of interest for the project. The Stanford Open Policing project collected and standardized data on vehicle and pedestrian stops from law enforcement across the country, including New Orleans. The researchers collaborated with agencies in different states to collect the data, making the data collection methods reliable. I will restructure the dataset, create dummy variables, and any other variables needed for the analysis using Python.
