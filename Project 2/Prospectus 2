# Prospectus Project 2

The project will examine Billboard 100 chart data and Spotify data containing song metrics. 
The central question I seek to answer is whether there are characteristics that popular songs in the Billboard 100 chart have in common. 

The visualization is intented for anyone who is interested in music, whether they listen to it or study it. The audience 
does not have to be familiar in order to understand the visualization. 

## Data
I will be using data obtained from here: https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017/workspace/file?filename=Hot+100+Audio+Features.xlsx 
The dataset compiles and scrapes Billboard and Spotify data. I do not need to do more analysis but will have to do aggregation.
